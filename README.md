# Classification-of-Micro-plastics-Based-on-Elemental-Composition
Code for ”Utilizing machine learning to accelerate the identification of plastics or microplastics via only their basic elemental compositions“
## Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing plastic mixture composition using machine learning models.  
It includes:

- Synthetic dataset generation for model training
- Experimental dataset validation
- Random Forest and MLP model training and comparison
- Learning curve and robustness analysis
- PCA visualization of polymer elemental features
